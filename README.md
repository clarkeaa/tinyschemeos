#tinyschemeos

16-bit operating system for i386 written in assembly and a scheme subset

##current state
A floppy-disk image can be created with the operating system installed.  It can be booted where you are presented with a REPL.  Right now it just matches parentheses and gives you an error if they don't match.

##acknowledgements
uses bootloader and some os functions from MikeOS (http://mikeos.berlios.de/)
